## Intro

This example project creates a Facebook Messenger bot in a Node environment via Express, mirroring the quickstart located in [Messenger Platform docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start) and built on top of the setup provided on [Glitch](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start) with a couple tweaks to play with [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/). 

The goal of this test is to explore the capabilities of Facebook's Messenger Platform via the Send API, as well experiment with Node environments on Google App Engine. 

## Setup 

This is primarily an echo bot that responds to a user's message by repeating their message back to them, with some added functionality accessible via certain keywords. This project is not dependent on any external libraries for it's core functionality, so it can be easily extended.For more detailed setup instructions, see [Messenger Platform Quick Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).
